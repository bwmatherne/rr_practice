# How to fold a paper airplane

## Introduction
Paper airplanes are great tools for wasting time while in class. They can be used to distract other students and aggrivate your teacher. Altering the design and folding patern of your paper airplane drastically changes the flight dynamics.

## Materials
* One Sheet of 8.5 x 11 inch paper
* Folding surface

## Methods
* Start with a crisp piece of paper and fold in half length wise. 
* The paper should now be 4.25 x 11 inches. 
* Open paper to original shape. Crease in the center is the new folding axis.
* Pull back one corner to the axis and create a crease. 
* Repeat on opposite side of the axis to create a symmetrical shape with a triangular point. 
* Fold paper in half along the axis.
* With the axis crease facing the table, fold down one side of the paper towards the axis. 
* Repeat on opposite side to again create a symmetrical airplane shape.
